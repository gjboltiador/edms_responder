# Security Configuration Guide

## Environment Variables Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, etc.):

```bash
# Database Configuration (REQUIRED)
DB_HOST=your_database_host
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_PORT=3306

# Optional Database Configuration
DB_CONNECTION_LIMIT=10
DB_SSL=false

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials to version control**
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive data
   - Add `.env` files to `.gitignore`
   - Use deployment platform's environment variable management

2. **Use strong passwords**
   - Minimum 12 characters
   - Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
   - Avoid common patterns or dictionary words

3. **Database Security**
   - Use SSL connections when possible
   - Restrict database access to specific IP addresses
   - Use dedicated database users with minimal required permissions
   - Regularly rotate database passwords

4. **Network Security**
   - Use VPN or private networks for database connections
   - Configure firewalls to restrict access
   - Monitor database access logs

### Deployment Platform Setup

#### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each environment variable
3. Set environment (Production, Preview, Development)
4. Redeploy the project

#### Netlify
1. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each environment variable
3. Redeploy the site

#### Railway/Render
1. Go to Service Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each environment variable
3. Redeploy the service

### Testing Configuration

After setting environment variables, test the connection:

```bash
# Check if environment variables are loaded
npm run dev

# Look for "Database connection successful" in logs
# If you see "Missing required environment variables", check your setup
```

### Emergency Response

If credentials are compromised:

1. **Immediately rotate database passwords**
2. **Review access logs for unauthorized access**
3. **Update all deployment environments**
4. **Consider database migration if necessary**
5. **Audit all code for exposed credentials**

# Full-Screen Map Navigation Features

## Overview

The Emergency Responder app now includes advanced full-screen map navigation with real-time location tracking and offline capabilities. This ensures responders can navigate to emergency locations even when internet connectivity is lost.

## Key Features

### 🗺️ Real-Time Location Tracking
- **Continuous GPS Updates**: Tracks your location in real-time with high accuracy
- **Location Permission Management**: Handles location access requests gracefully
- **Accuracy Indicators**: Shows GPS accuracy in meters
- **Background Tracking**: Continues tracking even when app is in background

### 🧭 Turn-by-Turn Navigation
- **Voice-Ready Instructions**: Clear turn-by-turn directions
- **Distance to Next Turn**: Shows remaining distance to next navigation step
- **Auto-Follow Mode**: Automatically centers map on your location during navigation
- **Manual Controls**: Option to disable auto-follow for manual map exploration

### 📱 Offline Capabilities
- **Cached Map Tiles**: Pre-downloads map tiles for offline use
- **Offline Routing**: Uses cached routes when internet is unavailable
- **Fallback Navigation**: Shows direct path when cached routes aren't available
- **Service Worker**: Handles offline functionality and background sync

### 🚨 Emergency Integration
- **Alert-Based Navigation**: Automatically loads active emergency locations
- **Severity-Based Markers**: Color-coded markers based on emergency severity
- **Real-Time Updates**: Refreshes emergency data when online
- **Emergency Info Panel**: Shows emergency details during navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Components

#### `EnhancedMapView.tsx`
- Full-screen map component with Leaflet integration
- Real-time location markers with accuracy circles
- Route visualization with offline support
- Turn-by-turn navigation overlay
- Map controls for auto-follow and centering

#### `useLocationTracking.ts`
- Custom hook for managing location tracking
- Handles location permissions and errors
- Manages navigation state
- Integrates with service worker for background sync

#### Service Worker (`sw.js`)
- Caches map tiles and routes for offline use
- Handles offline routing requests
- Manages background location sync
- Provides offline fallback functionality

### Offline Features

#### Map Tile Caching
```javascript
// Preloads tiles around current location
tileCache.preloadTiles(currentLocation, 16, 3)
```

#### Route Caching
```javascript
// Caches routes for offline use
routingCache.setRoute(origin, destination, routeData)
```

#### Offline Fallback
- Direct path visualization when cached routes unavailable
- Placeholder tiles for uncached map areas
- Graceful degradation of features

### Real-Time Updates

#### Location Tracking
- Uses `navigator.geolocation.watchPosition()` for continuous updates
- Filters updates to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Sends location updates to service worker for background sync

#### Navigation Updates
- Real-time route recalculation
- Distance and time estimates
- Current step detection based on location

## Usage

### Starting Navigation
1. Navigate to the Map page (`/map`)
2. Allow location access when prompted
3. Active emergencies will automatically load
4. Click "Start Navigation" to begin turn-by-turn guidance

### Offline Mode
- App automatically switches to offline mode when internet is lost
- Cached maps and routes remain available
- Real-time GPS tracking continues
- Offline indicator shows current status

### Map Controls
- **Auto-Follow Toggle**: Enable/disable automatic map centering
- **Center on Location**: Manually center map on current position
- **Zoom Controls**: Standard map zoom functionality

## Browser Compatibility

### Required Features
- **Geolocation API**: For location tracking
- **Service Workers**: For offline functionality
- **IndexedDB/Web Storage**: For caching
- **Modern Browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)

### Mobile Support
- **Progressive Web App**: Can be installed on mobile devices
- **Background Location**: Works with mobile browsers
- **Touch Controls**: Optimized for touch interfaces

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- **Map Tiles**: Cached with size limits to prevent storage issues
- **Routes**: Cached with expiration for data freshness
- **Static Assets**: Cached for offline app functionality

### Location Updates
- **Throttling**: Updates filtered to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- **Accuracy**: Only updates when location changes significantly (>5m)
- **Battery**: Optimized for mobile battery life

### Memory Management
- **Cache Limits**: Automatic cleanup of old cached data
- **Component Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of location watchers
- **Memory Monitoring**: Tracks memory usage for large caches

## Security & Privacy

### Location Data
- **Local Storage**: Location data stored locally only
- **No Tracking**: No external location tracking services
- **Permission Based**: Requires explicit user permission

### Offline Data
- **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive data encrypted when possible
- **Local Only**: No external data transmission
- **User Control**: Users can clear cached data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Location Not Working
- Check browser location permissions
- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for geolocation)
- Verify GPS is enabled on mobile devices

#### Offline Mode Not Working
- Check service worker registration
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Verify offline.html is accessible

#### Navigation Not Starting
- Ensure location permission is granted
- Check for active emergencies in the system
- Verify map tiles are loading properly

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true')
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Voice Navigation**: Audio turn-by-turn instructions
- **Traffic Integration**: Real-time traffic data
- **Multi-Stop Routing**: Support for multiple emergency locations
- **Advanced Offline Maps**: Vector-based offline maps
- **Location Sharing**: Share location with dispatch center

### Performance Improvements
- **WebGL Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated map rendering
- **Predictive Caching**: Pre-cache likely routes
- **Background Sync**: Enhanced background location updates
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory footprint

## API Integration

### Emergency Alerts
The navigation system integrates with the existing alert system:
- Fetches active alerts from `/api/alerts`
- Filters for pending/accepted emergencies
- Uses alert coordinates for navigation destinations

### Location Updates
Location data can be sent to the backend:
- POST to `/api/gps` for location tracking
- Includes dispatch_id for emergency correlation
- Supports background sync for offline updates

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_TILE_URL=https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png
NEXT_PUBLIC_ROUTING_API=https://router.project-osrm.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_OFFLINE_CACHE_SIZE=1000
```

### Customization
- Map tile providers can be changed in `EnhancedMapView.tsx`
- Routing services can be configured in the service worker
- Cache sizes can be adjusted in the respective cache classes
